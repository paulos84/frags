Hi Camilla. It was very flattering to receive you message. I do indeed enjoy living in Oxfordshire - I used to live here 10 years ago but since then lived in various places across the country for work reasons. It has got to be my favourite out of the places I have lived and so I'm glad I now have a permanent job here after a career change into a new field which I really enjoy. I see that you have taken up learning musical instruments - which ones? I own a good flute and used to be quite dedicated, but last few years I have focused all my effort in my work/career as this is important to me. Anyway, I hope you (and your chickens!) are enjoying the new surroundings, there is plenty more I could ask but hopefully will do so another time :)
